《片皮鴨半隻$238 半隻》半隻份量都足夠3人共享。片皮鴨撇走多餘脂肪後更加突出片皮鴨的香脆口感，再送上醬汁配料就更加美味。

第一次食酸菜魚，半份已經好大盆，兩個人食係食唔晒嘅！唔食得辣可以要求小辣。一上枱賣相已經相當吸引，先嚐一口，湯底濃郁，材料除魚片外，還有勁多配菜如鹹酸菜、辣椒乾、萵筍、芝麻、葱等等，味道又酸又辣，極其醒胃。桂花魚肉片分量比預期多，薄切，肉質好軟滑，味道鮮甜可口，魚油甘香美味。二人套餐（$438）呢個套餐非常之抵食，四百幾蚊有七樣嘢食，好豐富呀！香蔥雞蛋豆乾粒

皮脆，肉嫩，最好的是上枱前啲肥油已經被切走，所以唔會食到成口油。摩摩皮夠薄身，而且每片都隔有一張紙，唔拍黐埋一齊， 而且仲可保存摩摩皮嘅熱度。配料有青瓜、大蒜、萵筍，仲有哈密瓜條。醬汁也有三四款之多。咕嚕蝦球

📋二人套餐 $438二人餐包括前菜甜品等有七道菜，跟單點相比便宜得多，例如說：我點半隻北京填鴨+兩個湯都$300多，所以我們四人點了一個二人餐比較划算🙊🆗香蔥雞蛋豆乾粒🥢豆乾做佐料食得多，直接當前菜食就未試過坦白說，香蔥我覺得不需要🤣豆乾口感偏硬，咬下去比較實。而豆乾是沒有雞蛋味的，乾脆叫豆乾粒會比較實際🙊

⭐️青城山杏汁白肺湯🥣我自己對杏仁比較抗拒，但杏汁白肺湯工序麻煩，不多餐廳有，所以都要試試！一碗不多，裡面有雞腳，豬肉，菜乾等，杏汁味很淡，但湯清甜，感覺很潤喉潤肺，絕不是味精湯

👎🏻烤北京填鴨🦆食得京川菜當然對北京填鴨有所期待，誰不知真的失望！鴨一共分16片，怎樣都看不出是半隻鴨，皮薄得像豬肉紙一樣，但又硬又不香摩摩皮不錯，配料還可以，但醬料不行，尤其蘇梅醬，又酸又怪鴨肉眼看又乾又瘦，食又無味，口感有點似豬肉乾😂😂😂

今次評分有點尷尬，因為最期待的北京填鴨和酸菜魚的確十分失望！但其他菜式其實都頗為出色，加上價錢不貴，性價比高，所以餐廳還算是值得一試！不要食北京填鴨和酸菜魚就好了🤣🤣🤣但有件事的確不吐不快:電話訂枱時只可以訂7:00/8:00（其實我發現有人訂到7:30），其他時間都要walk in我訂了8:00，7:30已到，人多的嚇死！店員完全忙到門口一個人都沒有！ 我一直等到8點才有人理我，他是不會按你訂枱時間安排入座，而是訂了枱的人要再拿籌再等，但途中完全沒有人問你是否已訂枱，亦沒有說要等多久，想找人也找不到，十分無助！重點是其實很多人都訂了枱，但他還是會先讓給Walk in拿籌的人！真的要改善一下！"

北京填鴨廚師切得很漂亮，鴨皮沒有一點脂肪，摩摩皮伴隨着是四種醬汁（最特別是桂花醬）及四種配菜（ 哈密瓜，葱，青瓜，西芹）。反而用桂花醬配北京填鴨有驚喜。

6,茶聚,"約咗好耐冇見嘅舊同事係太古城康怡廣場嘅金公館飲茶。《金公館》個名聽落好似上海D高級別墅😂原來佢係一家集粵、京、川、滬嘅菜館。店內有大大張壁劃相當揚眼！我只知道佢哋係“大花面”🤭,吾知你哋又識吾識京川粵劇面相點分同有咩特徵呢?坐落一陣,叫咗壺香片。估吾到呢度採用自動加水同煲水,自己㩒個制就搞掂,相當方便！我哋點咗幾個點心蘿蔔千絲酥外皮一層層酥脆,內裡蘿蔔蓉鮮甜碧綠鮮蝦腸腸粉吾太厚,入口算滑,裡面d蝦都幾大隻爽口黑椒金錢肚金錢肚軟腍,有d蘿蔔係底杏片原籠馬拉糕馬拉糕鬆軟,上面有好多杏片蠔皇鮮竹卷外皮軟糯,內餡多汁呢度都幾受歡迎,午市同下午茶都幾多人等位！

7,行政有問題，對食客講大話！,"七點十五分，叫了一個餐內有小籠包一客，八點幾其他嘢上齊，吹了小籠三次也未到！八點三左右，經理同我地講小籠包賣晒（隔離枱也有不滿），要求轉其他食，咁早無小籠包之前D員工又唔覆就一定不滿，最後我估逼佢也無用，結果轉了其他食物！八點半，見到對面見隔離枱（他們起碼係八點入座）上小籠包！即時叫經理嚟，佢話「你地話轉其他食物ok」,我話「你騙我左先」結果說幾句唔好意思，笑一笑就走開！原來早到唔一定有得你跟餐的食物，遲到就會有！"
8,京川粵菜北京填鴨,"今晚嚟到太古康怡廣場嘅金公館，一次過嘗試吓京川粵菜。頭盤叫咗個雞絲粉皮，胡麻鮮淮山，仲有我最鍾意嘅椒鹽九肚魚，質素都唔錯，特別係椒鹽九肚魚，炸粉唔會太厚，九肚魚味突出。之後再叫咗個靈芝菇萵筍絲，我從來未食過呢一種菜，感覺好新鮮。然後，就係今晚嘅主角烤北京填鴨半隻，北京填鴨皮脆，肉厚，唔會太多肥膏，正合我心意。特別鍾意有桂花嘅醬，甜甜地，好適合。今日特別想食甜品，好彩中餐廳嘅甜品都唔錯，我哋叫咗雷沙湯丸，入面熱辣辣嘅芝麻超級好味，又叫咗杞子桂花糕同桂花冰粉，特別適合而家越嚟越熱嘅天氣。

9,出色片皮鴨,"今日陪屋企人去開太古食飯，當中有家人強烈推介呢間金公館作晚餐，於是去試一試先。餐廳座位都相當多，即使假日時，相信亦不用等太久。先點了一份椒鹽酥肉，一上枱已相當香，咬一口，肉質軟身，滲出淡淡的肉汁，證明師傅控制燶侯恰當，發揮出肉最好的質素，最加上旁邊有點點辣口的佐料，可為味蕾帶上點點的刺激，作開胃菜相當一流。然後是今天的重點美食片皮鴨，有片胸皮、胸肉及腿肉，而且份量亦較多，鴨油香濃厚，鴨肉則較結實，配上青瓜、黃麵醬與薄餅進食，食到最原始的風味。然後是金銀蒸娃娃菜，不得不說，粉絲完全吸收了香味，淡淡都食得出香味，配上娃娃菜的咬口口感，相當出色。

好耐無約過朋友飯聚啦，難得晚市可以堂食，大家返工又係港島區就相約3個好朋友聚下舊。同事就介紹了一間由正宗四川師傅主理的太古中菜─金公館，唔單只環境舒適，而且裝修富有中國特色，一於就揀佢啦！金公館依間太古中菜主打片皮鴨、酸菜魚，Venus 其中一個好朋友超鐘情於中國文化，連口味都非常中化，另一個就好鐘意食魚，最後嗰個就話想食辣，完全符合哂3位朋友所有要求。金公館中菜位於太古康怡廣場3樓，一出地鐵站搭電梯就到，非常方便就腳。一到門口已經見到好搶眼戲曲造型裝飾長鏡十分架勢！老壇子酸菜魚大家都好肚餓的關係，所以我哋叫咗好多餸，好似Venus其中一個朋友仔剛坐低就即刻叫咗老壇子酸菜魚。

Venus 本身怕腥、唔鐘意食魚，但見到隔離枱食到好滋味咁都想試試。令人驚喜係太古金公館中菜嘅酸菜魚唔腥之餘魚肉仲好滑，朋友仔都估唔到平時無點食魚嘅我會食完又食。

真係要大讚太古金公館中菜的酸菜，用咗無筋酸菜超爽脆，聽介紹先知原來醃制方法都好講究！係用四川成都傳統老壇古法醃制酸菜，酸菜用上原汁母水、秘制香料，將新鮮菜喺恒溫恒濕環境下醃20-30日。食落超入味，完全都唔輸蝕俾魚肉㗎！差啲唔記得仲有我最愛嘅薯粉做底，加埋酸菜湯底一齊食，酸酸辣辣超開胃！

薯粉好Q彈，吸收咗酸爽湯汁超好味！麻辣水煮滑牛肉再嚟又係大大碗上枱的麻辣水煮滑牛肉，本來以為湯底紅噹噹會辣到頂唔順，但食落又發覺其實唔係太辣，而且多咗香、麻味道，令上愈食愈上癮。牛肉火侯煮得剛好，肉質食落嫩滑唔會太老，而且份量非常之多，抵食！

麻辣水煮滑牛肉同樣地有薯粉做底，我一個人差唔多食哂2邊嘅薯粉。麻辣水煮滑牛肉絕對係「辣」朋友嚟金公館太古中菜必點。食咗兩道大菜後需要「休息」一下，叫咗蒜泥白玉同老火炖湯。嚟金公館太古中菜嘅蒜泥白玉比平日食嘅大塊好多，雖然係常見菜式，但中間夾青瓜食法都係第一次。不過唔好睇小青瓜夾肉片嘅配搭，一方面將口感提升一級，加倍爽口，另一方面又中和返蒜泥白玉本身嘅油膩感，更突出蒜香味道。

超多蒜，好香口。如果你係蒜泥白玉愛好者，嚟金公館太古中菜一定要試！Venus 好鐘意飲湯，不過講到豬肺湯就好少飲啦，因為工序麻煩到媽媽唔會想煲，即使食中菜餐廳都少見有，不過金公館太古中菜就有青城山杏汁炖豬肺湯啦。唔好以為炖湯就一定好厚重負擔，好似呢碗杏汁炖豬肺湯反而好清新，飲唔到一絲膻味證明豬肺處理得好乾淨，加上杏汁味好濃、好香，完全將前面食嘅濃味麻辣帶走。

實在太好飲啦，飲完成碗都唔夠喉！話晒金公館太古中菜除咗酸菜魚外，片皮鴨都好出名，無理由唔叫。所以壓軸登場嘅就係大家最期待烤北京填鴨！金公館嘅片皮鴨唔同其地方，無咁油膩，因為佢哋特登切走鴨皮中間多餘油脂，令到成塊鴨片下無太多脂肪，對於注重健康嘅香港人好友善。

食片皮鴨精粹在於皮，皮要烤得恰到好處其實好難，過火會太乾、未夠火候又唔夠脆，不過金公館太古中菜就做得唔錯，片皮鴨以傳統烤鴨方法配上獨特醬料烤製出香脆惹味口感，令人無辦法唔鍾意食。

單食一樣好正，加上配菜同醬料包食又係另一種滋味。即蒸摩摩皮薄軟糯，夾入香脆鴨皮、嫩滑鴨肉已經流哂口水！金公館太古中菜喺配菜及醬料選擇上提供8種款式口味：烤鴨醬、冰梅醬、胡麻醬、桂花蜜醬、京蔥、西芹絲、青瓜條、蜜瓜條，令片皮鴨風味變化更上一層樓。

一入口有熱辣辣軟糯摩摩皮、之後帶頭當然有香脆得嚟又唔會太油膩香脆鴨皮，之後有嫩滑鴨肉夾集解膩青瓜、爽口西芹絲、清新京蔥、香甜蜜瓜、帶點微辣香口芝麻醬、甜絲絲桂花蜜醬、酸甜冰梅醬、惹味烤鴨醬……就係咁口中充斥多層次味道幸福感覺，差啲一個人成哂全碟片皮鴨，實在太好味！食完絕對翻尋味！享受咁豐富好味嘅盛宴，以為已經可以滿足，不過朋友居然覺得唔夠完美，話一場嚟到金公館太古中菜叫多2碗擔擔麵試下，咁2人share一碗麵啦。

都真係幾大碗，細食或者好似我哋前面食咗咁多，真係可以2人share一碗。 湯底有少許麻辣味，麵線爽口彈牙，間唔中食到青蔥同芝麻令到成碗味道唔再單調。金公館：太古康山道1-2號康怡廣場3樓T4號舖"
11,美味佳餚,"今晚約了友人來到港島區的康怡廣場「金公館」晚飯，此店開業數年，口碑不錯，一間食肆能夠多元化地提供粵、川和京菜三處不同地方，不同口味的菜餚，實在並不容易。

店舖不算太大，但佈置簡約，員工殷勤有禮，此店其中一個特式是無須侍應沖茶，只要按按掣，水壺底部會注入清水，然後自動煲滾，頗有創意。

北京填鴨半隻，鴨皮片得好薄，沒有肥糕，皮薄，每塊皮包上一片鴨皮，青瓜，西芹，哈密瓜，甜醬，麻醬一齊食。超正。最值得一讚就係鴨肉，軟滑及鴨味香濃。

最初唔知原來每碟餸都咁大碟，所以我地仲加咗一碟脆香豬手，脆香豬手有驚喜，當職員將豬手放到枱上，貌似好硬，但食落口係軟綿綿的，少少辣夠嘢味。充滿骨膠原。

安坐後，才發現一個新玩意。這裡有個自動充水茶壺，放在裝置上，茶壺就會動加水及加熱，這個自動充水茶壺裝置真的很方便，可以隨時有大熱滾水泡荼，值得一讚。

限定優惠半價片皮鴨，當然不能錯過。這個片皮鴨夠派場，店員會先放下一個八寶盒，中間嘅蒸籠放左饃饃皮，而旁邊空格就分別裝有酸梅醬、桂花醬、甜醬、麻醬、青瓜條、京蔥絲、蜜瓜條等。主角片皮鴨，切成方塊，大小均勻，厚薄一致，有皮也有肉，食落皮脆肉嫩，夠油脂又不膩滯，跟配料、醬料用香軟饃饃皮包著食，好滋味。

青椒清香魚材料雖然簡單，但味道出奇的好。起骨草魚切成薄片，完全無骨，魚肉嫩滑有彈性。配料有青爽萵筍和菇片，再加上滿佈莞茜和芝麻的清甜湯底和幼滑烏冬，飽肚又健康。

14,普通午餐,常年收加一，茶水，但是不给纸巾？太古城分店几次要求说没有纸巾，明明疫情之前都是提供纸巾？连纸巾都不给，於人与不便，说是疫情理由所以不给。这是什麽规矩？疫情就不需要擦嘴？虽然味道好也挡不住服务一般，卫生程度下降。餐具几次去都是烫过碗上还有菜叶在。如果害怕纸巾沾染病毒，是不是碗具更应该消毒乾净些？邮件让我改食评与事实不符？我并非造谣为何要改，是不是分店应该改回提供纸巾？要不就免收加一？只可惜我没有印相留作证据。
15,一晚嚐盡。川京粵菜,"金公館位於太古康怡廣場，一出地鐵直達廣場再上三樓就到達，十分方便。地方簡潔乾淨，門口位置有京劇壁畫，很有特色。內進有舒適的卡座，旁邊放有自動充水及煮滾的水壺，略卻要找職員添茶的麻煩，十分方便！**茶芥 $13/位****花生小食 $10/碟**

第一次食酸菜魚，半份已經好大盆，兩個人食係食唔晒嘅！唔食得辣可以要求小辣。一上枱賣相已經相當吸引，先嚐一口，湯底濃郁，材料除魚片外，還有勁多配菜如鹹酸菜、辣椒乾、萵筍、芝麻、葱等等，味道又酸又辣，極其醒胃。桂花魚肉片分量比預期多，薄切，肉質好軟滑，味道鮮甜可口，魚油甘香美味。二人套餐（$438）呢個套餐非常之抵食，四百幾蚊有七樣嘢食，好豐富呀！香蔥雞蛋豆乾粒

皮脆，肉嫩，最好的是上枱前啲肥油已經被切走，所以唔會食到成口油。摩摩皮夠薄身，而且每片都隔有一張紙，唔拍黐埋一齊， 而且仲可保存摩摩皮嘅熱度。配料有青瓜、大蒜、萵筍，仲有哈密瓜條。醬汁也有三四款之多。咕嚕蝦球

📋二人套餐 $438二人餐包括前菜甜品等有七道菜，跟單點相比便宜得多，例如說：我點半隻北京填鴨+兩個湯都$300多，所以我們四人點了一個二人餐比較划算🙊🆗香蔥雞蛋豆乾粒🥢豆乾做佐料食得多，直接當前菜食就未試過坦白說，香蔥我覺得不需要🤣豆乾口感偏硬，咬下去比較實。而豆乾是沒有雞蛋味的，乾脆叫豆乾粒會比較實際🙊

👎🏻烤北京填鴨🦆食得京川菜當然對北京填鴨有所期待，誰不知真的失望！鴨一共分16片，怎樣都看不出是半隻鴨，皮薄得像豬肉紙一樣，但又硬又不香摩摩皮不錯，配料還可以，但醬料不行，尤其蘇梅醬，又酸又怪鴨肉眼看又乾又瘦，食又無味，口感有點似豬肉乾😂😂😂

今次評分有點尷尬，因為最期待的北京填鴨和酸菜魚的確十分失望！但其他菜式其實都頗為出色，加上價錢不貴，性價比高，所以餐廳還算是值得一試！不要食北京填鴨和酸菜魚就好了🤣🤣🤣但有件事的確不吐不快:電話訂枱時只可以訂7:00/8:00（其實我發現有人訂到7:30），其他時間都要walk in我訂了8:00，7:30已到，人多的嚇死！店員完全忙到門口一個人都沒有！ 我一直等到8點才有人理我，他是不會按你訂枱時間安排入座，而是訂了枱的人要再拿籌再等，但途中完全沒有人問你是否已訂枱，亦沒有說要等多久，想找人也找不到，十分無助！重點是其實很多人都訂了枱，但他還是會先讓給Walk in拿籌的人！真的要改善一下！"
18,一次過品嚐~京川粵菜式,"位於港鐵太古站A2出口的康怡廣場內有不少食店。   今晚好友約了在廣場三樓的""金公館""晚飯，聽名字頗有品位！   第一次來這個廣埸很有新鮮感！""金公館""的門面令人眼前一亮！京戲人物畫像鏡面作裝飾很有氣派！

這鴨皮帶鬆化帶點油份不會過肥,皮又帶點脆,真的酥香撲鼻,十分甘香,附有嫩鴨肉,可配京蔥,是配以青瓜和哈蜜瓜(好特別)帶點爽脆,還點特製多款醬,把好薄的薄餅捲起來,忍不住一口接一口吃,回味無窮。**【靈芝菇炒萵荀絲】

北京填鴨廚師切得很漂亮，鴨皮沒有一點脂肪，摩摩皮伴隨着是四種醬汁（最特別是桂花醬）及四種配菜（ 哈密瓜，葱，青瓜，西芹）。反而用桂花醬配北京填鴨有驚喜。
